In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object references and their modification within functions. Consider the scenario where a function modifies an object passed as an argument.  If the function directly manipulates the object's properties using the assignment operator, the changes will be reflected in the original object outside the function. However, if the function reassigns the object to a new instance or a different object altogether, the original object remains unaffected outside the function. This behavior can lead to unexpected results and is often hard to debug if not explicitly understood.

```php
class MyClass {
    public $value = 10;
}

function modifyObject(MyClass $obj) {
    // Modification 1: Changes reflected outside the function
    $obj->value = 20;

    // Modification 2: Does NOT change the original object
    $obj = new MyClass(); 
    $obj->value = 30;  
}

$myObj = new MyClass();
modifyObject($myObj);
echo $myObj->value; // Outputs 20 (Modification 1's effect)
```
